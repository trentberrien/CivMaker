# CivMaker
Minecraft plugin that allows players to create competing civilizations

Main idea: Clans work to be largest and wealthiest base/village

Core principles: 
	- Add incentives to continue playing while also working with/against other players 
	
  - New mechanics should not impact core gameplay
		
    ○ All materials/ gear should be gathered by normal means 
		
    ○ Addition of new incentives should not make resources scarce for normal use  
	
  - Players should feel like their work is not entirely vulnerable
		
    ○ Raiding should take a significant investment to conduct
    
    ○ Mechanics should be added to increase the protection of players items and builds

---Planned features---

Core mechanics:
Currency mechanics:
	
  • Items will be traded in for currency 
		
   ○ Possibly 1 netherite scrap = $10000, 1 diamond = $1000 (can be tweaked)
		
   ○ Should not be materials that are easily farmed
		
   ○ Possibly add money drop for mining naturally spawning ores like $1000 per emerald ore 
	
  • Shop at spawn to make transactions
	
  • Currency can be stored in "banks"
	
  • Player must carry a percent of their wealth on them
	
  • If a player is killed their money goes to the player who killed them 

Village mechanics:
	
  • Currency is used to start village and buy plots of land
	
  • A beacon which must be exposed to air and above a certain y level must be place at the village center
	
  • All village center cords will be public information
	
  • Only plot owners/ trusted members can place/destroy blocks and open chest under normal circumstances
	
  • Amount of plots that can be owned depend on amount of village members and other factors
		
   ○ Villages at a certain size must add additional beacons
		
   ○ A certain number of villagers must have a bed within the village plots in order to expand the village further
	
  • Points will be assigned to the size of the village, number of villagers, and money owned by the village
	
  • If beacons are destroyed, the claim to the village will be lost along with the protections
	
  • Per beacon, a certain % of stored currency within the village will be taken when destroyed 

Item shop:
	
  • Custom items will be added to the game to enhance added mechanics
	
  • "Lock picks" allow non trusted members to open doors/ chest that are otherwise protected a single time
	
  • "Secured vaults" will not allow chest to be picked
	
  • "Battering rams" can break down doors in protected plots
  
  • "C4" like TNT can be used to break only building blocks in protected plots

---Possible features---

Mechanics to prevent burnout/ high level of commitment:
	
  • When a beacon is destroyed, the village will have x days to pay a repair cost before the protections go away 

Marketplace and economy:
	
  • Players can sell items to other players at a price they set themselves.

War Mechanic:
	
  • States that declare war can bypass destroy/grief protections, but also leave their village vulnerable to anyone
	
  • May have minimum requirement of defending players online (offline raids = bad)

Further village requirements:
	
  • Minimum # of players to start a village (likely 3)
	
  • Max number of villages to be created to encourage large groups (5 or so)
	
  • Apply for village leadership

Misc:
	
  • Death caused by other player would make you temp banned for a set amount of time
		
   ○ +1 hour to make death significant
		
   ○ Can be skipped by payment (makes wealthy people who invested more time balanced with large groups who play less)
	
  • Purchasable perk system?
		
   ○ Hard to add perks that do not mess with base gameplay
		
   ○ Clash of clans shields???

Start with smallish world boarder to force people to be relatively close!
